# XDE TypeScript Labs

WIP:Development notes
- For better meshing between this laboratory and projects which are using its code, we temporarily
  rely on Git submodules feature. Some reasons are:
  - Developer-friendly. Easy to start develop, test, debug, push, etc even before employing any 
    sophisticated package/monorepo management tools.
  - Simplification. No need to involve overcomplicated tools for managing many monorepositories.
  - Scalability. This approach can be applied not to Node.js ecosystem only.

WIP:Map
Structured components map that can include not only packages provided here, but also link
third-party solutions to avoid reinventing new wheels.
